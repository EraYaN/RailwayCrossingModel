Group 8



Requirements:

* Some requirements are not verifiable.

* Most requirements are appropriate and SMART>

* The requirements cover the functionality of the system.

* Liveness requirements are present.

* Possible extensions are described.



Interactions:

* It is not clear what interactions are internal, and which are external.

* There is no consistency between the interactions in section 4, and the architecture in section 3.

* The interactions seem too coarse: it looks like all lights are turned on at once, instead of turning on individual lights; likewise for barriers.



Architecture:

* The architecture consists of 4 components (or 5, if I look at the description in 3.1?)

* The external interactions are not mapped onto the links in the architecture.

* I do not understand the component where the track sensor controller sends its information.



Requirements in terms of interactions:

* Most of the requirements have been translated correctly into the mu-calculus.

* Some are not correctly translated; especially when considering the sensors.



Model:

* Not described in the report

* The model consists of 6 parallel components, which is not consistent with the architecture, at least the way I read it.



Verification:

* Not described in the report



Quality of the report:

* The report is incomplete, but the part that is present is generally well-written.

* Verification is not yet reproducible.
