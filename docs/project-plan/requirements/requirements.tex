\chapter{Requirements}
In this section, we will gather and describe the requirements of our railway crossing system needed for the later design, modelling and validation.
First of all, we will enumerate and name the components of our system; and then describe the sequence in which they actuate in a fixed situation.
Finally, we will establish the requirements our system has to fulfil for its modelling.


%TODO[e] Please include the main letter is the designations like $L_{1}$ instead of L$_{1}$, this creates more consistency and recognizability.
\section{System Components} 
\begin{itemize}
\item 2 train tracks (T$_{1}$, T$_{2}$)
\item 2 crossing roads 
\item 2 Barriers (Ba$_{1}$, Ba$_{2}$)
\item 2 Pairs of flashing Lights (L$_{1}$, L$_{2}$) 
\item 1 Bell (Be)
\item 6 Train Sensors (S$_{1,w}$, S$_{1,m}$, S$_{1,e}$, S$_{2,w}$, S$_{2,m}$, S$_{2,e}$)
\end{itemize}

\section{Sequence}
As any other railway crossing system, the sequential operation in which the barriers will be closed and opened is the following:

\subsection{Barriers closing}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Lights start blinking
\item wait a few blinks, so no one is scared by an instant bell.
%TODO[c]: is this what we want?
\item Bells start ringing
\item Wait for all the cars to drive off of the intersection and give them time to brake/react.
\item Barriers close
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Barriers opening}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Barriers open
\item Bells stops ringing
\item Lights stop blinking
\end{enumerate}

In order to function this way, the system must have some constraints that are listed in the following section.


\section{System Requirements}
The most obvious requirement is of course that the system has to prevent cars from driving on the crossing when there is a train coming.

This means that the barriers have to be closed before a train enters the crossing and that they have to stay closed until the crossing is clear of trains.

Besides this trivial requirement, there are a couple other functional requirements for the system.

\begin{enumerate}
\item A train can arrive on both tracks from both directions.
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item When a train left the crossing and the barriers are opening again, a new train can retrigger the closing sequence again, which has priority over the opening sequence.
	\end{enumerate}

\item The beams, lights and bells on both sides of the track operate synchronously.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Definitions}
By Lights ON means the actual lights are blinking but Lights is just a continuous signal for the hardware controller that is responsible for the blinking.

A train `on the track' means that a train is somewhere, either partially or completely, between the two outer train sensors of a train track.

\subsection{Light}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Lights always have to be on on when a train is on the tracks
		\item Lights always have to be on on when the bell is on
		\item Lights may only stop blinking when the barriers are open and the bell is off and no train is on the tracks
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Bells}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Bells have to turn on a set (to be determined) time after the lights turn on.
		\item Bells may only stop ringing when the barriers are open and no train is on the tracks.
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Barriers}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Barriers always have to be closed when a train is on the tracks and both the lights and bells are on.
		\item Barriers have to close a set (to be determined) time after the bells start ringing.
		\item Barriers may only open when there is no train on the tracks.
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Sensors}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The Sensors node reads the three train sensors on a track.
		\item The Sensors node decides whether a train is on the track or not.
		\item The Sensors node indicates whether a train is on either of the tracks.
	\end{enumerate}


\section{Possible extensions}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Fault detection, recovery and signaling:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Bells: Detect if the Lights acted as they are supposed to and if not, recover the error and signal a operation fault.
			\item Barriers: Detect if the Bells acted as they are supposed to and if not, recover the error and signal a operation fault.
			\item Barriers: Detect if Barriers are really closed and if not, signal an operation fault.
		\end{enumerate}

	\item Extend the system with a Car detector to detect if all cars left the crossing.
	\item Extend the system with a Signal light for trains to indicate if the crossing is safe to enter.
	\item Adding an Sensor closer to the crossing so the system sooner knows that the tracks are clear.
	\item Double the output signals of each controller and add user access signal, so that if any output signal shows a discrepancy such as being the lights on and off at the same time, it can be manually corrected.

	\end{enumerate}
